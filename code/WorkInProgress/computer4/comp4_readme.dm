computer4 is a copy & paste and rework of comp3 code, by PJB3005

I decided to make this seperate of comp3 itself, for the following reasons;
	different design philosophy: there are a lot of things I want to do differently than comp3, but are largely subjective, I want to do TONS with wired networking, comp3 may not
	unknown intentions: I do not know how ponies wanted to do comp3, comp3 was largely WiP, and a lot of things that are mentioned in comments, aren't even defined, such as NETUP(), and their function not being mentioned anywhere
